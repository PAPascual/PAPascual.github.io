        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Audric dela Torre Pascual was born on December 6, 2004 at the United Doctors Medical Center at Quezon City.<sup>1</sup> While her older sister, Maria Paulina dela Torre
        Pascual was delivered normally, due to him being larger than average during development,
        Paul was a Cesarean delivery, and was considered a blessing to both parents, Maryell
            dela Torre Pascual and Apollo Relucano Pascual.<sup>2</sup> During his infant years, Paul, now
            nicknamed “Ic” was known as more of a reserved child.<sup>3</sup> He was not the kind of child that
            would easily cry.<sup>4</sup> Additionally, being born into a households containing different faiths
            meant that many morals were taught to him at an early age.<sup>5</sup> This is reflected in the fact
            that Paul is baptized in both the Catholic and Christian church.<sup>6</sup> At age 4, Ic started going
            to school at a private school called New Jerusalem School.<sup>7</sup> Initially, he was set to enter
            through Nursery, but due to an excellent aptitude, Audric was immediately put into Kinder
            1.<sup>8</sup> There, he met many new people and was educated properly.<sup>9</sup> One peculiar thing about
            Audric was that during his childhood, his proficiency in speaking English was higher than
            his proficiency with his mother tongue, Tagalog.<sup>10</sup> This urged his parents to buy him books
            in Tagalog to read.<sup>11</sup> Incidentally, this also made Paul infatuated with literature and further
            excelled his education.<sup>12</sup> This was made evident when not only was Paul achieving merits
            and honors every school year, he would also be constantly picked as representative for
            spoken poetry competitions.<sup>13</sup> However, due to the constant achievement and praise,
            Audric started to gain a bit of an ego.<sup>14</sup> His personality became somewhat of a bully, looking
            down on other classmates for being “less intelligent”.<sup>15</sup> Despite being able to make friends
            in elementary, his bad attitude led him to some serious situations and even being bullied
            as well.<sup>16</sup> This built a sort of distrust with people in general.<sup>17</sup> When he finally ended his
            elementary years, he found himself not being able to celebrate his achievements with
        others.<sup>18</sup> During his later years in elementary as, he found an interest in watching a certain
        type of YouTube videos called “Alternate Histories”.<sup>19</sup> This urged him to pursue creating
        videos as a sort of passion project and used this as an avenue to acquire new, more
        modern skills.<sup>20</sup></p>

        <p align="justify">As Paul Audric Pascual reached his teenage years, he moved schools to the
            University of East – Manila. His family and him also moved residency from Manila to
            Quezon City. As he entered secondary school, he started to gain an expertise in certain
            skills such as Mathematics and Science. However, a big problem for him still was his
            inability to make friends, nor keep them. While he was in Grade 7, he usually found
            himself joining clubs such as the Boy Scouts and the SINAG Science Club, but never being
            able to find genuine friendships until Grade 8. This is when with the help of his classmates,
            was able to refigure himself and start being able to fix his personality around others. This
            was also around the time where Paul started to get into anime. Particularly, he had found
            a special interest in the Love Live franchise. This interest then soon sparked into a genuine
            interest in music which led Paul into joining Music Aficionados, the music club in high
            school. Whilst he may not have fully pursued the club in 9th Grade, he still continued with
            his other clubs and even gained some officer roles such as Senior Crew Leader (SCL) and
            Vice President. However, all of that changed drastically when the pandemic hit in 2020.
            With school being forced into the online setting, Paul had to adapt with using the Internet
            and various gadgets to continue his education. However, due to his prior experience in
            content creation and web surfing, he found himself easily adapting to the situation and
            used this knowledge to his advantage. Being known as the “Online Scoutmaster”, he was
            able to host and coordinate multiple events for not only his club, but his school too in just
            the comforts of his own home. This trend continued all the way until the 2nd semester of
            12th Grade. This was when the quarantine was lifted to a point where schools can
            implement face-to-face classes again. But by this time, Paul’s whole personality,
            confidence, and environment had completely changed. For him to return to his prior self
            would be a completely new challenge. Thankfully, even with his tonal shift, he found
            himself some good people to surround himself with. Even through an ankle injury he
            acquired sometime in 2022, his classmates and school life went well despite all the sudden
            happenings. During graduation, Paul had decided that he would pursue a career in the
            tech field and become a systems developer. With all the help the Internet has given him,
            he takes it to the level by taking IT in college.
            <br><br>College would prove to be a different beast in and of itself for Paul. He went into
            a course where the people around him were already proficient in the material. But an
            advantage he had from the others is that he’s able to learn quickly. Paul was able to
            follow along the syllabus with ease except for one subject. “Understanding the Self” was
            only a minor class yet its requirements felt like a major for Paul. This kind of subject
            focuses on theoretical and opinionated answers. The kind that he is not used to. So,
            during the first semester of college, he found himself absolutely struggling with such a
            simple class that he’d hurt himself for it. While now he looks back at it with irony, he
            wishes that it won’t ever happen to him again. Besides that, the second semester went
            fine without any major problems. His only qualm was that his programming professor to
            understand the situations of his students instead of preaching. Throughout this whole
            time, he had maintained a relatively high performance. This was reflected in his average
            grades of 1.50s and 1.25s. But this performance was only because he had fear. He feared
            that if he didn’t perform well in his studies, his parents would be disappointed with him.
            And so, during the first semester of 2nd year, he started being more desperate. It all came
            into a boiling point when he was caught cheating and thus, failed his test. Thankfully, the
            professor was kind enough to let it slide and tell Paul to not worry about failing. The only
            thing he needs to do is do his best and pass. As of now, those words stuck with him and
            ever since, he doesn’t feel scared of not doing good enough. All of this would’ve made a
            great story if it weren’t for 2025’s happenings. Early into the year, Paul suffered a fracture
            in his arm from his own classmate. This meant that he’d have to spend most of his second
            semester with an injury. And while that part of the bio is still underway, he hopes that he
            can face it with the same feeling he had during senior high.</p>
