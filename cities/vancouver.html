        <h1>Why I Want To Go There</h1>
        <p>During the pandemic, I had relied on the Internet to help me find a social group. This one particular circle of friends I was in had people from this city. When they were describing their homeotwn, I found myself interested in visiting it one day.</p>
        <h1>How To Get There?</h1>
        <p>For foreigners and cross-continent travel, the Vancouver International Airport should be your layover. From MNL, the average price should be around 55,000 pesos. However for those in America, the Amtrak allows you to get to Vancouver through  Seattle and Portland.</p>
