            <h2>Modern Family</h2>
            <p><b>Airing Years:</b> 2009-2020</p>
            <p><b>Genre:</b> Comedy, Sitcom, Family</p>
            <p><b>Director:</b> Cristopher Lloyd; Steven Levitan</p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Synopsis:</b><i> Parents Phil and Claire yearn for an honest, open relationship with their three kids. But a daughter who is trying to grow up too fast, another who is too smart for her own good, and a rambunctious young son make it challenging. Claire's dad, Jay, and his Latina wife, Gloria, are raising two sons together, but people sometimes believe Jay to be Gloria's father. Jay's gay son, Mitchell, and his partner, Cameron, have adopted a little Asian girl, completing one big -- straight, gay, multicultural, traditional -- happy family.</i></p>
            <p><br> I'll be honest, I never really enjoyed sitcoms. However Modern Family somehow just hits the right spots in my taste somehow and I enjoyed all the seasons of this show until the finale.</p>

            <h2>Jeopardy!</h2>
            <p><b>Airing Years:</b> 1964-Present</p>
            <p><b>Genre:</b> Gameshow</p>
            <p><b>Director:</b> Merv Griffin</p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Synopsis:</b><i> A daily syndicated American television quiz show in which three contestants try to win money as they are quizzed on all types of triviaâ€”history, science, math, geography, language, popular culture, and more. The long-running program, which has won dozens of Daytime Emmy Awards, is a cultural staple and consistently rates as one of the most popular shows in the country.</i></p>
            <p><br>Gameshows in contrast, were the kind of shows I seemed to enjoy the most. Jeopardy being the standout as it satisfied my craving of curiosity with its trivia format.</p>

            <p><br>I watched the movie during its premiere. Prior to this moment, I've never cried for a piece of media until the ending of the movie hit.</p>

            <p><br>The best Marvel movie ever made. During the final scene of the movie, I didn't think I would feel emotional about it but the story made everything hit the right spots.</p>
