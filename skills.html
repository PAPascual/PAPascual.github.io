        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my lifetime, I've learned many skills due to the experiences and environment around me. Even at the start of my schooling, my parents had wanted me to stand out from the other kids. The first thing they tried to teach me was to gain an educational advantage. With my father being a teacher, he and my mom wanted for me to be able to absorb and understand information quickly. And so, I was taught various memorization techniques and was put to the test constantly by parents, usually being made to answer pseudo quizzes at home. During this whole process however, they had found that I had a knack within the Mathematics field. Even during gradeschool, the lessons taught in the said subject were no match for me as I would constantly be getting perfect marks back then. The proficiency I had in Math eventually led to an expertise in the logical Sciences. Topics like Algebra, Geometry, Chemistry, Physics, and such were my strong suit, and the people around me noticed that. I became a representative for my school in multiple Math and Science competitions, even bringing medals back as proof of the school nurturing my talent. But deep inside, I had other talents that I pursued without much supervision. One of these was my talent for music and singing, which sprouted when my parents made me become a choir member for my church when I was 7. It was mostly something I had developed in my free time, but did eventually turn into a skill that I can be semi-proud of. The skill in vocalization also turned into gaining knowledge in basic Music Theory. Learning what makes music work and what sounds to use was a very delightful experience I’m happy I put myself on. Another skill that had sprouted from my early interests was the skill of speaking languages other than my mother tongues. I had an infatuation with the flags of other countries when I was young so this led to me learning about their languages and culture. This was further heightened during the pandemic when, using the power of online messaging, was able to communicate with people all around the world. This allowed me to practice conversations in these other languages. Specifically, I have gotten conversation-level proficiency in Japanese and in Korean.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've found myself doing hobbies that you wouldn’t expect from someone like me. The most surprising one in my opinion is my hobby of vocal mixing. To explain, vocal mixing is the process of properly applying the voices to a song. This is usually the overlooked part of producing songs as this enhances the listening experience when one listens to songs. I found myself starting this hobby back in 2020. During the pandemic, I always knew I had interest in music and my curiosity led me to trying different aspects of music production. This then led me to becoming a vocal mixer for mine, and others’ songs. In relation to my songs, another hobby of mine is singing. After I stopped being a choir member back in 2019, I still found myself retaining the techniques I learned. This then grew into a hobby of singing Japanese songs in particular. This has continued to grow and a wish of mine is to eventually turn this into something I can profit from. Lastly, one of my favorite hobbies is managing and hosting Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) campaigns. D&D is a TTRPG where your players roleplay in a fictional setting, usually set by a game master. I am one of those game masters who create entire worlds and stories for my players. This started back in 2018 after some lowerclassmen showed me their campaign. At that point, I was hooked and eventually started creating worlds of my own. This has grown to the point where I have ran multiple campaigns and have given my passion to hundreds more people. Notably, I was known for being able to port the pen-and-paper hobby to the online setting. Multiple documents, a whole encyclopedia of materials and guides was made during these 7 years. It is a hobby I can be truly proud of.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interests are quite related to my hobbies. A notable one is my love for anime. I started watching anime back in 2017 as I was introduced to it by one of my classmates. This then spiraled into days where I found myself watching anime late into the night. Particularly, I was very interested in the Idol Anime genre. A genre in which their characters become a singing group to sing cute and lively songs. There were days where I wished I could be like them. They always left inspiring and motivating messages to raise the audience’s morale in their songs. In addition to that, they always incorporated dancing into their songs. Which leads me to my interest, dancing. Now you wouldn’t usually think of me as a dancer. And I am not. However, the different styles and the expression of feelings through movements made it mesmerizing to watch. I remember when I even dragged my friend to learn some dances with me, no matter how unsuccessful we were. Another interest I have is the particular genre of Rhythm Games. Games such as osu!, Maimai, PRSK, and more have been a constant for me since high school. These are games where you have to hit notes to the rhythm of a song. These games can get intense and competitive, yet I enjoyed that aspect of it. I even had a time where I participated in tournaments of these games. And even until now, rhythm games have always been a de-stressor for me despite their difficulty.</p>
